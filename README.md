# Washer-Dryer-Notifier
This code monitors changes in a vibration sensor to detect when a washer/dryer starts and ends. When VIBRATION_MONITORING_THRESHOLD is exceeded (when the vibration sensor triggers enough to guarantee it is not a false positive), the system begins to monitor the vibration sensor, looking for a significant stopping point. If the vibration sensor stops for VIBRATION_STOPPED_TIME_DELAY_SECONDS, then this code sends a notification to the IFTTT Webhooks platform, which subsequently publishes a notification on the subscribed phones. If vibrations do not exceed VIBRATION_MONITORING_THRESHOLD, and the amount of time between the last vibration exceeds VIBRATION_COUNTER_RESET_DELAY_SECONDS, then the vibration counter will be reset to 0.  There are optional delays added for when the system changes state from Monitoring Stops to Waiting for Threshold. These can be commented out.
